                    <p>
                        Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous
                        quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a
                        daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United
                        States to catch a thief who has stolen the original
                        weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along
                        the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies
                        determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to
                        terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle
                        that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.

                    <p>
                        When Thalia’s tree is mysteriously poisoned, the magical
                        borders of Camp Half-Blood begin to fail. Now Percy and
                        his friends have just days to find the only magic item
                        powerful to save the camp before it is overrun by
                        monsters. The catch: they must sail into the Sea of
                        Monsters to find it. Along the way, Percy must stage a
                        daring rescue operation to save his old friend Grover,
                        and he learns a terrible secret about his own family,
                        which makes him question whether being the son of
                        Poseidon is an honor or a curse.

                    <p>
                        When Percy Jackson gets an urgent distress call from his
                        friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He
                        knows he will need his powerful demigod allies at his
                        side, his trusty bronze sword Riptide, and… a ride from
                        his mom. The demigods rush to the rescue to find that
                        Grover has made an important discovery: two powerful
                        half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that’s not
                        all that awaits them. The titan lord Kronos has devised
                        his most treacherous plot yet, and the young heroes have
                        just fallen prey.

                    <p>
                        Percy Jackson isn’t expecting freshman orientation to be
                        any fun, but when a mysterious mortal acquaintance
                        appears, pursued by demon cheerleaders, things quickly
                        go from bad to worse. Time is running out for Percy. War
                        between the gods and the Titans is drawing near. Even
                        Camp Half-Blood isn’t safe, as Kronos’ army prepares to
                        invade its once impenetrable borders. To stop them,
                        Percy and his friends must set out on a quest through
                        the Labyrinth — a sprawling underground world with
                        surprises and danger at every turn.

                    <p>
                        All year the half-bloods have been preparing for battle
                        against the Titans, knowing the odds of victory are
                        grim. Kronos’s army is stronger than ever, and with
                        every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil Titan’s
                        power only grows. While the Olympians struggle to
                        contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his
                        advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands
                        virtually unguarded. Now it’s up to Percy Jackson and an
                        army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time.
