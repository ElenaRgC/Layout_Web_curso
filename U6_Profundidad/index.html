                        Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous
                        quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a
                        daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United
                        States to catch a thief who has stolen the original
                        weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along
                        the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies
                        determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to
                        terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle
                        that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.
